📘 Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction

Machine Learning project using Logistic Regression to classify whether an object detected by SONAR is a Rock or a Mine (Metal cylinder).

🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a binary classification model that can analyze SONAR returns and predict whether the object is a rock or a mine.
This dataset is widely used in machine learning and comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

📂 Dataset

Name: Sonar Mines vs Rocks Dataset

Rows: 208

Features: 60 numeric frequency-based features

Target:

R → Rock
